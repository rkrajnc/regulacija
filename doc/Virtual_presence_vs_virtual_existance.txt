Virtual presence vs virtual existence 


Virtual existence (on web):
  - Second life & stuff
  - Facebook & other accounts

Virtual presence (in reality):
  - not be there
  - act there

Control over internet:
  - lights
  - heating
  - consumption (analyze & optimize)

Smart houses:
  - technology ready & on market
  - not many examples in reality

Industry:
  - many other uses
  - in fancy buildings & offices
  - not many in working halls, where most of energy is consumed

Problems:
  - to expensive?
  - more wires instead of less
  - new buildings only
  - no real need?
    - energy efficiency increasingly popular
    - laziness also

Opportunities:
  - simpler & scalable design
  - small cheap units
  - fit into existing buildings


My current work:
  - micro controller (C)
  - visualization & configuration - PC (Python, CherryPy, HTML)
  - strict separation (uC fully independent, PC or tablet - UI)
  - HTML works everywhere - no platform specific apps

The web part:
  - CherryPy - HTTP Framework (+ xml.etree)
  - integrated server
  - easy authentication & SSL

My problems:
  Why I'm here:
  - lack of time
  - lack of discussion
  - lack of practical experience

Last words:
  Often talented people devote to complex
  and long term tasks. Or things, as I say,
  which only help people to waste their time, e.g.
  Facebook. Or things, that improve life of only few 
  rich people. I think, there are many more valuable
  opportunities, where humanity, or, if you prefer,
  your income, might gain more.
